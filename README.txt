Interactive AtLA CYOA - README.txt
Release v0.1a at 2014-07-27
Created by Varymicus for /tg/
Based on the image CYOA by Anonymous

--VERSION HISTORY--
-v0.1a created 2014-07-27
First build of the site

--PREFACE--
Heya, /tg/. While I loved the original CYOA, the tedium of zooming in and out, back and forth across an image of tiny "words, words, words" inspired me to create this interactive version.
This is my third attempt at an interactive CYOA adaptation, and while I've improved my skills it won't be too fancy. I'll continue to work on this as time (and motivation) permits, so I look forward to your feedback and help in this regard. I'll also try to keep an eye on CYOA threads, but I can be reached at cyoafeedback@gmail.com.
In the meantime, I hope you enjoy!

--INSTRUCTIONS--
The interface should be pretty intuitive, but there are a couple of points I'd like to highlight anyway:
- There is no "undo" button - choosing something will lock the previous tier. This means that if you choose "Waterbending", you can still change your mind; but if you start picking styles and techniques you'll need to reload the page to be an Earthbender.
- Choices will be enabled or disabled based on dependencies, so read the descriptions.
